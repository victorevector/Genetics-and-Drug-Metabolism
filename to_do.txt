Functionalities:
+ability to establish connection with 23andMe API, in accordance with OAUTH2
+ability to request relevant information from API (DEFINE RELEVANT! INFORMATION)
+ability to parse through data and render the proper response for user



Ive constructed the first draft of my Client. It can successfully create an Oauth2 connection

What i need to work on is the client's ability to request adequate information from the API
To do:
Figure out use case and edit client so it streamlines the API get process. I want to engineer the relationship betwen profile and genotype information. For example, each login profile could include multiple users. So I have to figure out a way to ask the client for whom they want to run the 'sensitivity test'. Once that information is specified, I need to match that name with a user id. That user id will be included in the get request's parameters. 

REFACTOR views.INDEX:
    +Consolidate param data to settings.
