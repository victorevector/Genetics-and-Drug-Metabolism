A person's genome can be used to gauge his or her positive or negative reaction to a certain medical drug. This app searches your genome (hosted on 23andMe) for the existence of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The existence of certain SNPs correlates to probabilistic reactions to certain drugs.
